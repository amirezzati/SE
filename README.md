**Phase 1: Prototyping Social Media**      
In this phase we designed an social media app prototype for IOS users.       
For this application, we considered the features of posting post, creating groups, forums, publishing news and several other features. The  users can follow their friends and also communicate with them in groups or forums.    
- You can check out our designs in this [Figma Design File](https://www.figma.com/file/DISw8Sr7Vf29dIoqPsnOx4/Software-Engingeering?node-id=0%3A1&t=VKr1hUstaSruKEIT-1).
